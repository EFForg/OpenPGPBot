# Using OpenPGP in Linux

Greetings, Linux users!

The first step is to install GnuPG, Thunderbird (an email client), and Enigmail (the GPG add-on for Thunderbird).

If you are using a Debian-based distribution such as Debian, Ubuntu, or Linux Mint, open a terminal and type these commands to make sure you have the right software installed:

    sudo apt-get install gnupg thunderbird enigmail

If you're using using a Red Hat-based distribution such as Red Hat or Fedora Core, open a terminal and run these commands:

    sudo yum install gnupg thunderbird thunderbird-enigmail

## Configuring Thunderbird and Enigmail

Now that you've installed Thunderbird, open it. You you will see the first run wizard. To set up your existing email address, click "Skip this and use my existing email". Then enter your name, email address, and the password to your email account.
